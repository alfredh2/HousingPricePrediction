# House Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project! This project is a machine learning endeavor that uses various algorithms to predict house prices based on a set of features. The core of this project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle's California Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It includes features like the size of the house, number of rooms, location, etc.

## Model
We use various regression models like Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict house prices. The model selection and tuning are demonstrated in the notebook.

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/alfredh2/HousingPricePrediction.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository.
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Notebook
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open the `CaliHousingPrices.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and model predictions.


## Results
The notebook includes a detailed analysis of model performance and accuracy metrics. We compare different models and discuss the best-performing model for this dataset.
